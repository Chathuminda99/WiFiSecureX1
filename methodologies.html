                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In this project, we utilized a combination of methodologies to ensure thorough analysis and accurate results. The methodologies include:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Literature Review</h3>
                <p>We conducted an extensive literature review to understand the current state of wireless security and the effectiveness of existing tools. This helped in identifying gaps and areas for improvement.</p>
                
                <h3>2. System Design</h3>
                <p>The system design phase involved creating a detailed architecture for the wireless security auditing tool. This included the selection of hardware components, network setup, and software specifications.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Data Collection</h3>
                <p>Data collection was performed using a Raspberry Pi equipped with wireless network adapters. Both passive and active scanning techniques were employed to gather data on access points, signal strengths, and security configurations.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>Collected data was analyzed to identify vulnerabilities and security risks. Machine learning algorithms were applied to detect patterns and predict potential threats.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Implementation</h3>
                <p>The implementation phase involved developing the tool's software components, including the reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment modules. The tool was tested in a controlled environment to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Validation</h3>
                <p>Validation was conducted through a series of tests and real-world scenarios to verify the tool's effectiveness in identifying security vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with HIPAA and PCI DSS regulations.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Reporting</h3>
                <p>The final step involved generating detailed reports based on the analysis, highlighting identified vulnerabilities, recommended actions, and compliance status.</p>
